Submit source code and running instructions to EAS<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Submit the textual component as a block comment at the top of your code. Do it in Java. Do not use java’s search methods! Place textual responses for 2 and 3 in block comments in your code.

<strong>Grade: </strong>5%

<ol>

 <li>You have the following array 1<em>,</em>5<em>,</em>17<em>,</em>22<em>,</em>33<em>,</em>37, known to be sorted. Write a program that demonstrates a Θ(log(<em>n</em>)) time or better (in the average case) algorithm to determine if the value 5 is in that array.

  <ul>

   <li>Make sure your program allows as input on the command-line a comma-separated (free of spaces) list of integers (the above being just an example).</li>

   <li>As output to stdout, each step along the way, on a single line, indicate what value you checked, followed by the symbol &lt;, &gt; or =. e.g. The last line for this example would be “5=” (without the quotes)</li>

   <li>If the searched for value is not found, the last line should simply be a “!” (without the quotes)</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>In clear, natural language, give the name of your algorithm and explain in a generalized step-wise manner how it can be applied to an arbitrary array when searching for an arbitrary value.

  <ul>

   <li>This textual response should be no more than 5 lines / 50 words.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>In clear, natural language, describe how you would change your algorithm to search over Strings instead of integers.

  <ul>

   <li>This textual response should be no more than 4 lines / 40 words.</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>
